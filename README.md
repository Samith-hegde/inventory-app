# Games Inventory App

The Games Inventory App is a basic web application developed as part of the Inventory Application Project for the Node.js module in The Odin Projectâ€™s Full Stack Development Course.

This project was built for practicing and applying learned concepts in Node.js, including Express.js for server-side functionality, route and controller setup, MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and form handling. The app utilizes PostgreSQL as the database.

Note: This project does not include any styling and is not production-ready.
